        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          Some people go for nice hikes. Given the choice, I'd rather be on a
          rainy bushwhack through slide alder, or sneaking through a bebb willow
          thicket somewhere looking for cool bugs. I'm not sure whether this is
          the visible tip of some iceberg of subconscious masochism, but I justify
          it in all kinds of fun ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to imagine that no one else has ever been where I'm standing. It
          takes hard work to imagine that well, given the walmart bags and
          antique tin cans we've scattered through the forest here and everywhere.
          I'm committed, though, or should be, because I'll walk for hours just to
          get a little farther from the road than I did last time.

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          My fascination with the natural world is born mostly of my inability to
          pay attention to things that aren't moving, when other things are. Birds,
          bugs, rodents, large mammals, snails that appear suddenly after the first
          spring rain. I don't know all their names, but I know some of them well
          enough to think of them as neighbors.

        <h2>Eating Stuff</h2>
        <p>
          And what could make a weird slimy thing more interesting, than if you
          could turn it into a delicious meal? And then eat it? Quick omelettes
          full of pine spikes or lactarius, crawfish etouffee from invasive mudbugs,
          tassel-eared tamales... It would be hard to choose a favorite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, in the process of putting as many oddball organisms as I
          could find on my kitchen table, I learned a good deal about how to find,
          identify, and cook them all.
