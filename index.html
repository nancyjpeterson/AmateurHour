        <h2>This Site</h2>
        <p>
          This site is an ongoing exercise in learning to program pages and
          applications for the web. It's not so pretty, but design has never been
          my strong suit. Hopefully it shapes up incrementally.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you know your way around web development,
          you won't learn much here, but I sure will. That, after all, is the point.

        <h2>Why I'm building it</h2>
        <p>
          The work I'm doing here is bounded, for now, by the need to meet course
          requirements for Northern Arizona University's CS212: Web Programming.
          In the future, this site may serve as a jumping-off point for a personal
          portfolio site. Knowing me, it's just as likely that it will lay conceptual
          groundwork for an entirely new build. Sometimes it's easier to start fresh
          than refactor old work.

        <h2>Things I hope to learn about re: web programming</h2>
        <p>
          As a very young front-end developer, I'm getting plenty of mileage out of
          writing raw html and CSS. That said, I plan to use available tools to
          take some of the redundancey out of my markup, and some of the pain out
          of the inevitable re-styling I'll have to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long view, I'd love to have the fluency to continue expanding on
          what things this site can <i>do</i>, harness a framework like bootstrap
          to make some fancy image gallery work easier, and use it to show off the
          backend development skills I'm building.
